  # Positivity-Jar                                                                                                                                                                                               
   
   ## Background
   
   One thing that we can perhaps all agree on is that during the pandemic, work, life, and work/life balance hasn’t exactly been made easy for all. It’s hard sometimes to motivate yourself to get up and functio    n. And the consequence is that from time to time, we fall into a slump of pessimistic thoughts and lack of enthusiasm. This is where Positivity Jars can help! Those are physical mason jars into which you and     your friends or family keep positive thoughts. Every time something nice happens that you’d like to remember, write it down on a little piece of paper with the date and toss it into the jar. At the end of t    he year, the group sits together and takes turns from the jar, remembering the good times. Try it!
   
   ## Objective
   
   The objective of this project is to design and implement software which allows you and your group of choice to maintain a virtual positivity jar. Running on a website, the app shall allow someone to sign up,     set up a new jar, and send invitation links to their friends, inviting them to participate. Daily reminders and convenient access is important – who remembers to take time out of their day to write a piece     of paper? Instead, come up with an innovative way to add pieces of paper to the virtual jar.
  
  ## Key Features & Challenges
  The system features should have the following:
  - Be written in Java and run on IBM’s OpenLiberty dynamic web server engine
  - Allow public users to create, remove, update, delete jars
  - Add/remove users to an existing jar
  - Maintain an appropriate record of each entry so they can be remembered the best way
  - Send occasional reminders and allow users to add a thought from the reminder
  - Once a specified time is up, allow users to “take turns” and pull a thought from the jar to read to the group.
  - Generate a “jar review” of the best moments since last emptying the jar
